The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there might be issues if the calculation results in a negative value, especially with properties like `width` or `height`, which cannot be negative.  This can cause unexpected rendering issues or unexpected behavior.  For example, if the calculation results in -10px for width the browser might ignore it completely or handle it differently depending on the context. 
Another uncommon error is forgetting that `calc()` requires spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /). For example, `width:calc(100%-50px);` is incorrect and should be written as `width:calc(100% - 50px);`
